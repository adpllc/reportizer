## Report an Issue
If you spot a problem with the code or documentation, or if you want to request an enhancement, create an issue.
For smaller changes, we prefer a pull request being made without an issue, but if you don't have the means to make a pull request right away, feel free to create an issue anyway.
Be sure to explain _why_ you think the change should be made, as well as a sufficient amount of detail about what needs changing. This includes a step by step method of reproducing any bugs (preferably with some sample code).
## Create a Pull Request
We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in this repository, so please ensure all commits in your pull request match this pattern. If the pull request addresses an issue, include `closes #<issue_number>` in your pull request title. e.g: `feat: make the doohickey wobble closes #42`
Wait for a review from a member of our team and address any comments we make. Feel free to disagree and suggest better strategies. That is what makes open source software so great! Remember to follow the Code of Conduct as you do so.
Make sure any code changes are accompanied by appropriate tests that do not decrease the code coverage. The easiest way to do this is to follow [test-driven develpoment](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd).
